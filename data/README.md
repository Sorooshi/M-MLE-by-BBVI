The datasets, the classification results and the results of metric(s) in use are stored in .pickle file.


The classification results of all algorithms under consideration are stored with following format:

	output_Nama_of_Experiment.pickle   # This contains the classification labels of all algorithm under consieration for the current experiment


The metric results are stored with the following format (means and stds):

	stats_Nama_of_Experiment.pickle   # This contains the mean and standard deviation of all algorithm under consieration for the current experiment


The Data sets will be either generated by running classification_comparison.py or they will be loaded from the corresponding files stored this folder.

Note: Some data sets or results etc are compresses due to volume limits of GitHub repository. Do not forget to unzip them.
